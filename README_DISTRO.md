# Collab 2024 - The Goblin Menace
A map for Dungeon Siege LoA.

_Journey through five different lands made by five different modders and defeat the Blasted Goblin!_

This map was created as a collaboration project on the Kingdom of Ehb Discord in 2024.\
Each collaborator created a part of the map, which were then stitched together.

## _Chapter III: Underland_ by Firstie
_Deep below the surface of the world, there lie wondrous lands where crystals and mushrooms grow..._

About me: I've been modding and map-making for several years now - my work includes maps like Pentachoron Garden, Empire of Stars and Green Range, mods like Wintermod, Halloween and the Summons Collection, as well as the GasPy script collection and the Minibits resources collection.

About my contribution: For the collab, I created a land of caves, completely underground. Once you made it through the upper layer of dirt and worms, you'll enter a layer of crystal madness, and below that lies a magical land where the Underlings live in a forest of giant mushrooms. Focus was on landscaping and worldbuilding, rather than questing or combat. I hope you like the journey through Underland - it's certainly the low-point of the collaboration!

## _Chapter IV: Shattered Crossings_ by Sadowson
_A broken bridge, an ancient curse..._
